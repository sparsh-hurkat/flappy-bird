    title: "How do you see OpenSesame fitting into your career journey or long-term goals?",
    response: `I’m interested in OpenSesame because it sits at the intersection of AI \
and scalable software systems, areas I want to specialize in as a software engineer. \
I came to CMU to deepen my technical foundation, especially in distributed systems, \
agentic workflows, and deploying large scale software. Working at OpenSesame feels like the right next step.

I’m excited about the chance to work on production systems that integrate AI into real \
workflows. I’m particularly drawn to environments where I can push the boundaries of \
performance, reliability, and intelligent automation, whether that means optimizing \
pipelines, refining system architecture, or contributing to new AI-driven capabilities.

Long-term, I want to help pioneer the shift from traditional software to fully autonomous \
systems, building software that feels intuitive, adaptive, and deeply integrated into \
people’s every day lives, almost like an extension of their own capabilities. OpenSesame \
feels like the ideal place to contribute to meaningful software while leveling up my AI \
engineering skills in a practical, product-focused setting..`

    title: "What strengths, skills, or perspectives will you bring to OpenSesame to make an impact?",
    response: `I bring a strong full-stack engineering background, experience building \
production-quality web applications, and a mindset focused on delivering clean, \
scalable, user-centered software. I’ve worked extensively with modern JavaScript \
frameworks like React and Next.js, built backend systems using Java Spring Boot and \
Node.js, and designed APIs, database schemas, and end-to-end features that support \
high-traffic usage. I’m also comfortable picking up new technologies quickly— \
I learnt Phaser.js from scratch and built a full game within just 4 hours to \
showcase that adaptability.

Beyond application development, I have hands-on experience deploying and operating \
cloud-based systems. I’ve worked with AWS services, serverless workflows, and modern \
CI/CD pipelines, which helps me think about reliability, monitoring, and scalability \
from the start rather than as afterthoughts.

I also bring the perspective of an engineer who enjoys experimentation and building \
tools that make products smarter and more efficient. Recently, that’s meant integrating \
intelligent features—semantic search, personalization, and workflow automation—into \
existing apps.

Most importantly, I bring curiosity, strong communication, and a collaborative approach. \
I care about understanding the “why” behind a feature, aligning it with real user needs, \
and shipping clean, maintainable code that moves the product forward.`

    title: "What excites you most about working with AI, and how do you think it can shape the future of learning?",
    response: `What excites me most about working with AI is its ability to turn \
    learning from something static \
    into something adaptive, personalized, and truly interactive.\
    From an engineering perspective, I’m excited by the challenge of building systems \
    that combine scalable software, good product design, and intelligent models in a way that feels \
    seamless to the user. AI opens the door to things like personalized content generation, \
    dynamic explanations, skills-based assessments, and contextual recommendations, not just \
    showing information, but guiding people through it.
    Looking ahead, I think AI will make learning feel less like consuming material and more \
    like having a collaborator. Traditional learning tools are built around one-size-fits-all content, but AI \
    makes it possible for systems to understand what a learner knows, how they think, \
    and what they’re struggling with, then adjust in real time.`
